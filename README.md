# Overview
This project involves the analysis of the "Full TMDB Movies Dataset 2023", a comprehensive collection of approximately 930,000 movies sourced from The Movie Database (TMDB). The dataset provides rich insights into movie-related variables such as titles, ratings, release dates, revenues, budgets, genres, and more. The primary goal of this project is to analyze financial metrics (e.g., budgets, revenues, profits) and qualitative factors (e.g., audience preferences, genres) within a defined 10-year period (2013â€“2023).

# Dataset Source
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle in October 2023. TMDB is a community-built platform, and while the dataset's diversity enables global film industry analysis, its collaborative nature may introduce unverifiable inaccuracies.
